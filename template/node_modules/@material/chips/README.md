## Variants

### Leading and Trailing Icons

You can optionally add a leading icon (i.e. thumbnail) and/or a trailing "remove" icon to a chip. To add an icon, add an `i` element with your preferred icon, give it a class of `mdc-chip__icon`, and a class of either `mdc-chip__icon--leading` or `mdc-chip__icon--trailing`.

We recommend using [Material Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/) from Google Fonts:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
</head>
```

However, you can also use SVG, [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), or any other icon library you wish.

#### Leading icon

```html
<button class="mdc-chip">
  <i class="material-icons mdc-chip__icon mdc-chip__icon--leading">event</i>
  <span class="mdc-chip__text">Add to calendar</span>
</button>
```

#### Trailing icon

A trailing icon comes with the functionality to remove the chip from the set. If you're adding a trailing icon, also set `tabindex="0"` and `role="button"` to make it accessible by keyboard and screenreader. Trailing icons should only be added to [input chips](#input-chips).

```html
<button class="mdc-chip">
  <span class="mdc-chip__text">Jane Smith</span>
  <i class="material-icons mdc-chip__icon mdc-chip__icon--trailing" tabindex="0" role="button">cancel</i>
</button>
```

### Choice Chips

Choice chips are a variant of chips which allow single selection from a set of options. To define a set of chips as choice chips, add the class `mdc-chip-set--choice` to the chip set element.

```html
<div class="mdc-chip-set mdc-chip-set--choice">
  ...
</div>
```

### Filter Chips

Filter chips are a variant of chips which allow multiple selection from a set of options. To define a set of chips as filter chips, add the class `mdc-chip-set--filter` to the chip set element. When a filter chip is selected, a checkmark appears as the leading icon. If the chip already has a leading icon, the checkmark replaces it. This requires the HTML structure of a filter chip to differ from other chips:

```html
<div class="mdc-chip-set mdc-chip-set--filter">
  <button class="mdc-chip">
    <span class="mdc-chip__checkmark" >
      <svg class="mdc-chip__checkmark-svg" viewBox="-2 -3 30 30">
        <path class="mdc-chip__checkmark-path" fill="none" stroke="black"
              d="M1.73,12.91 8.1,19.28 22.79,4.59"/>
      </svg>
    </span>
    <span class="mdc-chip__text">Filterable content</span>
  </button>
  ...
</div>
```

To use a leading icon in a filter chip, put the `mdc-chip__icon--leading` element _before_ the `mdc-chip__checkmark` element:

```html
<div class="mdc-chip-set mdc-chip-set--filter">
  <button class="mdc-chip">
    <i class="material-icons mdc-chip__icon mdc-chip__icon--leading">face</i>
    <span class="mdc-chip__checkmark" >
      <svg class="mdc-chip__checkmark-svg" viewBox="-2 -3 30 30">
        <path class="mdc-chip__checkmark-path" fill="none" stroke="black"
              d="M1.73,12.91 8.1,19.28 22.79,4.59"/>
      </svg>
    </span>
    <span class="mdc-chip__text">Filterable content</span>
  </button>
  ...
</div>
```

### Input Chips

Input chips are a variant of chips which enable user input by converting text into chips. To define a set of chips as input chips, add the class `mdc-chip-set--input` to the chip set element.

```html
<div class="mdc-chip-set mdc-chip-set--input">
  ...
</div>
```

#### Adding Chips to the DOM

The MDC Chips package does not handle the process of converting text into chips, in order to remain framework-agnostic. The `MDCChipSet` component exposes an `addChip` method, which accepts an element which is expected to already be inserted within the Chip Set element after any existing chips. The `MDCChipSet` component will then handle creating and tracking a `MDCChip` component instance.

For example:

```js
input.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.keyCode === 13) {
    const chipEl = document.createElement('div');
    // ... perform operations to properly populate/decorate chip element ...
    chipSetEl.appendChild(chipEl);
    chipSet.addChip(chipEl);
  }
});
```

> _NOTE_: `MDCChipSet` will generate a unique ID to apply to each added chip's element if it does not already have an ID
> when it is passed to `addChip`. This is used to distinguish chips during user interactions.

#### Removing Chips from the DOM

By default, input chips are removed in response to clicking the trailing remove icon in the chip. Removal can also be triggered by calling `MDCChip`'s `beginExit()` method.

Individual `MDCChip` instances will emit a `MDCChip:removal` event once the exit transition ends. `MDCChipSet` will handle destroying the `MDCChip` instance in response to `MDCChip:removal`, but it must be removed from the DOM manually. You can listen for `MDCChip:removal` from the parent Chip Set or any ancestor, since the event bubbles:

```js
chipSet.listen('MDCChip:removal', function(event) {
  chipSetEl.removeChild(event.detail.root);
});
```

### Pre-selected

To display a pre-selected filter or choice chip, add the class `mdc-chip--selected` to the root chip element.

```html
<button class="mdc-chip mdc-chip--selected">
  <span class="mdc-chip__text">Add to calendar</span>
</button>
```

To pre-select filter chips that have a leading icon, also add the class `mdc-chip__icon--leading-hidden` to the `mdc-chip__icon--leading` element. This will ensure that the checkmark displaces the leading icon.

```html
<button class="mdc-chip mdc-chip--selected">
  <i class="material-icons mdc-chip__icon mdc-chip__icon--leading mdc-chip__icon--leading-hidden">face</i>
  <span class="mdc-chip__checkmark">
    <svg class="mdc-chip__checkmark-svg" viewBox="-2 -3 30 30">
      <path class="mdc-chip__checkmark-path" fill="none" stroke="black"
            d="M1.73,12.91 8.1,19.28 22.79,4.59"/>
    </svg>
  </span>
  <span class="mdc-chip__text">Filterable content</span>
</button>
```

## `MDCChip` and `MDCChipSet` Properties and Methods

The MDC Chips package is composed of two JavaScript classes:
* `MDCChip` defines the behavior of a single chip.
* `MDCChipSet` defines the behavior of chips within a specific set. For example, chips in an input chip set behave differently from those in a filter chip set.

To use the `MDCChip` and `MDCChipSet` classes, [import](../../docs/importing-js.md) both classes from `@material/chips`.

#### `MDCChip`

Method Signature | Description
--- | ---
`beginExit() => void` | Proxies to the foundation's `beginExit` method

Property | Value Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`id` | `string` (read-only) | Unique identifier on the chip\*
`selected` | `boolean` | Proxies to the foundation's `isSelected`/`setSelected` methods
`shouldRemoveOnTrailingIconClick` | `boolean` | Proxies to the foundation's `getShouldRemoveOnTrailingIconClick`/`setShouldRemoveOnTrailingIconClick` methods\*\*
`ripple` | `MDCRipple` (read-only) | The `MDCRipple` instance for the root element that `MDCChip` initializes

> \*_NOTE_: This will be the same as the `id` attribute on the root element. If an `id` is not provided, a unique one will be generated by `MDCChipSet.addChip()`.

> \*\*_NOTE_: If `shouldRemoveOnTrailingIconClick` is set to false, you must manually call `beginExit()` on the chip to remove it.

##### Events

Event Name | `event.detail` | Description
--- | --- | ---
`MDCChip:interaction` | `{chipId: string}` | Indicates the chip was interacted with (via click/tap or Enter key)
`MDCChip:selection` | `{chipId: string, selected: boolean}` | Indicates the chip's selection state has changed (for choice/filter chips)
`MDCChip:removal` | `{chipId: string, root: Element}` | Indicates the chip is ready to be removed from the DOM
`MDCChip:trailingIconInteraction` | `{chipId: string}` | Indicates the chip's trailing icon was interacted with (via click/tap or Enter key)

> _NOTE_: All of `MDCChip`'s emitted events bubble up through the DOM.

#### `MDCChipSet`

Method Signature | Description
--- | ---
`addChip(chipEl: Element) => void` | Adds a new `MDCChip` instance to the chip set based on the given `mdc-chip` element

Property | Value Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`chips` | `ReadonlyArray<MDCChip>` | An array of the `MDCChip` objects that represent chips in the set
`selectedChipIds` | `ReadonlyArray<string>` | An array of the IDs of all selected chips

## Usage within Web Frameworks

If you are using a JavaScript framework, such as React or Angular, you can create Chips for your framework. Depending on your needs, you can use the _Simple Approach: Wrapping MDC Web Vanilla Components_, or the _Advanced Approach: Using Foundations and Adapters_. Please follow the instructions [here](../../docs/integrating-into-frameworks.md).

### Adapters: `MDCChipAdapter` and `MDCChipSetAdapter`
